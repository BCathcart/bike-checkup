Most cyclists are aware of the importance of keeping their bike well-maintained; however, without software, it is difficult to keep track of the mileage on each component of each bike. Bike Checkup makes these tasks easy by integrating with Strava and providing cyclists a secure place to keep track of the time/distance riding on all their bikes and their components, as well as create their own bike maintenance schedule with push notification reminders.

## Front End Demo Video

This short demo video was part of the deliverable for this project. The first half contains an extremely quick walkthrough of the front-end code base and the second half I explain what our automated UI testing is doing as it runs.
